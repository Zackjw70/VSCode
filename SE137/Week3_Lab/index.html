            <h2>Bio</h2>
            <p>My name is Zachary Wyeth. I am 19 years old. I live in a small beach town by the name of East Lyme, Connecticut. Niantic is about 50 minutes away on 95 south from new england tech. I live with my two parents and have a sister. I have lived in Niatic for my whole life but plan to move away once I have finished school. I have two dogs named Titan and Lady along with two black cats named Salem and Binx. I have a girlfriend named Julia whom i have been with for about nine months. <br>I came to New England Institue of Technology to pursue Cyber security but after two terms I had changed my mind and switched over to software engineering so i can focus more on coding. I plan to get a job wiht my degree back near my hometown and then hopefully move down to Virginia or somewhere even farther south.</p>
